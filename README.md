## Overview
This notebook presents a garbage classification task utilizing a hybrid model that integrates DistilBERT for text processing and MobileNetV2 for image feature extraction. The model is trained to categorize images into four classes—black bin, green bin, blue bin, and other—by using both textual and visual information to enhance the accuracy of prediction.
